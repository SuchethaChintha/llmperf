        "RESPONSE": "In the realm of poetry, where words weave emotions, I find myself pondering on your request. Let's embark on a journey through the text you've provided, streaming lines as we go.\n\n\"Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss,\" the poet laments, struggling to find the perfect words to immortalize their beloved. The fear of inadequacy is palpable, a common sentiment among artists striving for perfection.\n\n\"Leaving thee living in posterity?\" They question, seeking to ensure their love's legacy. The desire to leave a lasting impact, to keep their love alive even after they're gone, is a poignant theme.\n\n\"Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\" they plead. Time, the relentless enemy, erodes all things, even love. Yet, the poet hopes their words can outpace this decay, preserving their love's radiance.\n\n\"Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\" they caution. The poet's passion is not to be squandered on trivial matters. Their heart, laid bare in their verses, demands respect and sincerity.\n\n\"Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\" a warning, perhaps? The poet's heart, given wholeheartedly, is not a plaything to be discarded.\n\n\"Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again,\" they remind. A love given is a love kept, a bond unbroken by time or circumstance.\n\n\"Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long,\" the poet calls out, seeking inspiration. The Muse, often elusive, holds the key to their creative prowess.\n\n\"Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,\" they confess. Their words, though carefully crafted, are but a garment for their true emotions. The depth of their love is hidden beneath layers of metaphor and verse.\n\n\"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\" they vow. Their love, immortalized in their poetry, will endure as long as humanity itself.\n\n\"Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,\" the poet implores. Their love's beauty, their muse, inspires them to create, to pour their heart into their art.\n\n\"With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd,\" they urge. Their love's beauty, a treasure to behold, must be captured in their verses before it fades away.\n\n\"Thou art,\" they begin, but alas, our token limit has been reached. The poet's words, though truncated, leave a lasting impression, a testament to their love and devotion.",
