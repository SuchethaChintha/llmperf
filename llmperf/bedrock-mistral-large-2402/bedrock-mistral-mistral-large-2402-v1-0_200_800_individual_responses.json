They assert that even as they grow older, their love will remain unchanged, as it is \"in character\" and \"eternal.\" The speaker also touches on the theme of memory and the power of the imagination to preserve the past, calling on the \"forgetful Muse\" to help them remember and redeem the past. The speaker also mentions the idea of \"five hundred courses of the sun,\" which could be a reference to the passage of time or to the number of years they have been in love. Overall, the text explores the complex and enduring nature of love and memory in the face of the inevitable passage of time.",

        "Response": "In the following lines, the speaker expresses a desire for a \"record\" (which can be interpreted as a memory or a document) to not be \"self-will'd\" and to accurately reflect the fairness and beauty of the subject. The speaker acknowledges that possessing such a record would be cause for triumph, while lacking it would leave room for hope. The speaker also notes that the subject's pen has both skill and argument, suggesting that they are a talented writer.\n\nThe speaker then notes that the \"eye of heaven\" (which could refer to the sun or to God) can sometimes shine too brightly, and cautions the subject not to rely on their own heart when the speaker's heart has been \"slain\" (presumably by love or by some other emotion). The speaker suggests that doing so would allow the subject to avoid the \"scythe and crooked knife\" of death.\n\nThe speaker then compares the subject to a \"captain jewel\" in a \"carcanet\" (a type of necklace), noting that such jewels are thinly placed and highly valued. The speaker also compares the subject to a tender nurse who protects her baby from harm.\n\nFinally, the speaker declares that those who are worthy (such as the subject) have a wide scope for action, and that the speaker's love for the subject lives in their own breast just as the subject's love for the speaker lives in theirs.",
