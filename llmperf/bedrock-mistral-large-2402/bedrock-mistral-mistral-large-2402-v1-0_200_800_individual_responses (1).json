The speaker also mentions the \"fine point of seldom pleasure\" and how it can be dulled by new experiences that release one's \"imprisoned pride.\" The speaker then warns against becoming Death's conquest and leaving one's heritage to the worms.

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.\n\nThe above text is a combination of lines from William Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 and Psalm 3 from the Bible. The text reflects on the power and glory of God, and the speaker's desire to give praise and fame to their love. The speaker also reflects on the summer's day and compares it to their love, and how their love is more enduring and unchanging than the summer's day. The text also speaks of the blessings that come from faith and belief in God, and how God is a shield and protector for the speaker. The text ends with a call for God to arise and save the speaker, and a declaration of salvation belonging to the Lord.",
